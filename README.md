# findafilm

findafilm is a Next.js web app written in TypeScript for searching for movies and related data. It uses [TheMovieDB](https://themoviedb.org)'s API to fetch from, [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com) for its UI library, and Jest/Testing Library, Prettier, ESLint, Husky, and Plop for testing, linting, and git hooks.

This is currently a project I'm working on to practice setting up Redux Toolkit, which will be added soon to replace the current React Context that serves as state management for the app.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
